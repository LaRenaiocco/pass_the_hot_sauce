	<h1>Pass the Hot Sauce</h1>
	<h3>A Roswell Podcause</h3>
	<h4>The Podcast</h4>
	<p>Pass the Hot Sauce is a twice monthly podcast focused on the classic teen alien 
		high school drama Roswell. We’re discussing the original series episode by episode, 
		spoiler-free. Join us every other Tuesday as we dive deep into the angsty, 
		spicy goodness.
	</p>
	<h4>The Hosts</h4>
	<p>
		<span>LaRena</span> 
		is a queer California native who grew up in the 90’s obsessed with all that teen angst 
		on the WB. From Roswell to Buffy to Dawson’s Creek, she watched it all. When she grew 
		up she did what most people dream of and ran away to the circus for eight years. 
		LaRena can currently be found adulting in NYC as a software engineer, professional 
		Ravenclaw, nerd trivia champion, and avid theatre goer.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span>Lisa</span> 
		is a dog mom, Jazz Fest enthusiast, and Walt Disney World aficionado. She is a proud 
		supporter of the arts in her adopted hometown of New Orleans, LA. Her hobbies include 
		attending community theatre, hosting cabaret nights, and anything that involves costumes. 
		Lisa strongly recommends that everyone experience Mardi Gras in New Orleans at least once 
		(she promises it’s totally family-friendly). Although she’s a baby of the late 80s, 
		Lisa somehow missed out on all the teen drama series that aired during her middle and 
		high school years. She can’t quite remember what she was doing at the time—probably hanging 
		out in AIM chat rooms or practicing for her Bat Mitzvah—but she’s excited to finally dive 
		in to the wonderful world of Roswell.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span>Aliza</span> 
		is a proud Jewish woman living in Massachusetts and loving all of the teen sci-fi that the 
		world has to offer. When she is not watching Roswell, she can also be found working with 
		youth on the Autism spectrum, geeking out on languages (she speaks four), and helping 
		spread fat positivity and body-posi vibes to everyone. Aliza has been a fan of Roswell 
		since it originally aired and is pleased to be sharing that love with new and long-time 
		fans alike.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span>Ashley</span>, 
		our producer and audio editor, is a music and TV loving Tennessee resident and Animal 
		Mom to two cats and two dogs. She started down the path of all things nerdy at the 
		ripe age of nine when she discovered and fell in love with Buffy The Vampire Slayer. 
		She is a Social Worker by day but in her time off she enjoys traveling and going to 
		live concerts and music festivals. While Buffy remains her favorite show, she is also 
		a huge fan of shows like Wynonna Earp, Veronica Mars, Stranger Things, and Parks and 
		Recreation. She somehow missed Roswell in its prime, but is so excited to be taking 
		this journey now!
